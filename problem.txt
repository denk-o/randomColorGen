Part 1: Build a class that generates a random color
Colors are randomized using fair coin method
There are any color in the Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
Include a method that returns the hex value for the color chosen
Include a method that returns the decimal code (r,g,b) for the random color
RGB values range from 0 to 255

Part 2: Build a biased random color generator
The random generator is bias
For this exercise there are only four category of colors
Red (40-255, 0,0)
Green (0, 40-255, 0)
Blue (0,0,40-255)
Grayscale: the RGB values must all be identical ranging from 0-255
The main categories are biased, but within those categories, which color you return in random by fair coin
The bais is passed in as a parameters of the class and doesnâ€™t alter for that instance (object)
Include a method that returns the hex value for the color chosen
Include a method that returns the decimal code (r,g,b) for the random color

Note, in regards to the bias, we are referring a percentage of being chosen for each color. how often we want those specific colors to be generated. example:
(red=30, green=10, blue=50, grayscale=10) means that red will have a bias of 30% chance being chosen, blue 10%, green 50%, so on and so forth.
